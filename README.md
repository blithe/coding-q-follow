# Strava Programming Problem - Follows

## Installation

- clone this repository
- install bundler (http://bundler.io/)
- install Ruby 2.1.1 or higher
- run ```bundle exec rspec``` from the root of this repository

## The problem

Your job is to implement a simple system to model follower/friend relationships between athletes. The system should support:

- one athlete following another athlete
- one athlete requesting to follow another athlete (if the target athlete must approve all his/her followers)
- one athlete blocking another athlete

The ```coding_question_spec.rb``` file outlines in detail the expected behavior. Once all the tests in that spec file pass, you're done!

Please send your solutions to us via email (chris@strava.com) - you can zip up your cloned version of this repository. Along with the code, please include a written introduction to your solution, that explains the design and implementation decisions you made and why.

If you have any questions, or have trouble running the specs, please let me know!
